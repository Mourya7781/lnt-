AIM
To configure and understand the working of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in a simple LAN setup using Cisco Packet Tracer.

REQUIRED
PCs, 8-port switch, LAN cables, Cisco Packet Tracer software.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Design and set up a LAN network in Cisco Packet Tracer and demonstrate how ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses for communication between devices.

SCOPE OF SOLUTION
Helps learners understand ARP functionality within LAN networks in a simulated environment. Provides knowledge of how devices map IP to MAC addresses. This understanding can be extended to larger networks and advanced routing protocols.
